                        My girlfriend of six, close to seven, years had just broken up with me.<br>
                        <br> 
                        April 1st. The date is easy to remember because my best-friend thought it was a joke, and I desperately wanted it to be some cruel prank.<br>
                        <br>
                        “I don’t see a future with you- at least, not anymore.”<br>
                        <br>
                        I was devastated. <br>
                        <br>
                        I put on my thickest sweater, got the keys to my black hybrid Lexus hatchback, and went for a drive. Each night I drove, and I drove, and I drank coffee, and I drove. Through the hills of Orange County, between the narrow streets of Hollywood, along the curves of the Los Angeles Crest Highway, I drove. Between a mix of sad Jazz songs, and Kanye West’s 808s and Heartbreak, between bouts of tears and glimpses of happiness, I drove. <br>   
                        <br> 
                        Whether it was the abnormal amount of caffeine in my system, or the toxic exhaust gases from my local Cars and Coffee, I had a great idea: 
                        <br> 
                        <br>
