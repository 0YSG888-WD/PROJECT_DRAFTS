The date is easy to remember because my best-friend thought it was a joke and I desperately wanted it to be some cruel prank.<br><br>“I don’t see a future with you- at least, not anymore.”<br><br>I was devastated.<br><br>I put on my thickest sweater, got the keys to my black hybrid Lexus hatchback, and went for a drive. Each night I drove, and I drove, and I drank coffee, and I drove. Through the hills of Orange County, between the narrow streets of Hollywood, along the curves of the Los Angeles Crest Highway, I drove. Between a mix of sad Jazz songs, and Kanye West’s 808s and Heartbreak, between bouts of tears and glimpses of happiness, I drove.<br><br>Whether it was the abnormal amount of caffeine in my system, or the toxic exhaust gases from my local Cars and Coffee, I had a great idea:<br><br><br>

All my life I’d envisioned myself in a BMW e92 M3. Manual, naturally aspirated V8, 9k redline, 414 horsepower, finished in Silverstone Metallic with black leather interior.<br><br>At least I got one thing right. It’s silver.<br><br>The listing for the Mercedes read like fiction:<br><br>2004 CL55 AMG - newly listed, one owner, garaged, 45,000 miles driven mainly on weekends, maintained religiously at Fletcher Jones in Newport Beach, AND they just replaced the cross-drilled brake rotors. A fifteen year old car for 15,000 dollars. I contacted the private seller to meet up for a quick test drive, but he handed me the keys and let me have the car for an entire day.<br><br>The first time I closed the heavy door the world around me muted.<br><br>I heard nothing but my own excited breath and knew that a Mercedes Benz with dual-paned windows, light-grey leather interior, supercharged, 493 horsepower, 512 pound-feet of torque was exactly what I needed in my life at this moment.<br><br>At sunset I returned the car, a few days later I wrote a check, and in the first two weeks I put one-thousand miles on the odometer.<br><br>My best-friend called it a “Quarterlife” Crisis.</p>

A car’s power isn’t always related to its engine displacement or torque figure. A car can be a friend, a companion, a system of support that may break down, but will never break you down.<br><br>Oftentimes, where we’re going isn’t where we’re headed.<br><br>Two years later...<br><br>My best-friend is no longer someone I consider a friend, and my new best-friend has a very nice singing voice above 2,000 rpm. The AMG has brand new rear tires which, for some inexplicable reason, have worn quite quickly during my ownership. And I am a few days away from the [two year] anniversary with my new and incredibly beautiful girlfriend. We started dating soon after I bought the Benz.<br><br></p>
