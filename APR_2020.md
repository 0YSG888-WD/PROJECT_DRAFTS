            - My database migrations glitched so I had to scrap the entire db, migrations, and cache folder. Resulting in me having to recreated my database including all the information in it, which halted all my progress. However, I was able to minimize all of my code for displaying all the items into one function and onto one rendered page. So that was a huge success.
