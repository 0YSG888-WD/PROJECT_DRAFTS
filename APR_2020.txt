JQuery UI [!] < NOT NECESSARY
CSS UI [*]
	- Notes: onclick="openNavFunctionHere()"
	- document.getElementById('idHere').style.<property_here>
	- Function can also query two separate IDs, one for the nav, 
	  and another to set margins for the main content of the page 
	OR 
	- document.querySelector('.class_name_here').style.<property_here>
	- .querySelector queries the CSS selector
	- And another function that closes
Flexbox [!]
Z-Index [!] 
CSS Properties: VW and VH [*]
Parallax [*]
	# const parallax = document.getElementById("parallax");
	# window.addEventListener("scroll", function() {
	# let offset = window.pageYOffset;
	# parallax.style.backgroundPositionY = offset * 0.7 + "px";
	# )}
	- js code effects position of background image in juxtaposition to
	- the content on the page
